The GitHub repo that hosts this site has been updated to use Git LFS for large file storage. This let's us host datasets larger than GitHubs file size limit of 100 MB. If you use this site only to download resources, this change should not effect you. If you have a fork of the repo and/or what to contribute to it, you will need to enable LFS and re-sync. If you are using the devcontainer configuration, this should be handled for you by re-building the container after syncing your fork.
